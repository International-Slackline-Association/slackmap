# Slackmap V2 Proposal


## Intro

Slackmap v1 was developed by Piotr xx since xx. The Platform is userfed with line-data and has about xx entries so far. Piotr stopped developing the platform in 2018 due to a shift in interests, the platform remains working with some major flaws (deletion of lines is not possible, line management not allowed, access restrictions can not be communicated, etc.)

## Project Scope

In broader concept, Slackmap v2 aims to:
- Provide global information for travelers
- Act as a "topo" guide
- Form a contact between slackliners in interest and the regional communities & authorities (managers of the spot etc)
- It does **NOT** provide any `social media` oriented features where people can organize meetings, festivals, inform each other about the currently-active gatherings.

## Project Concerns

- Simplicity. It must focus on simplicity both in technical and presentational aspects simply because,
  - It needs to survive potentially decades with volunteered effort which requires long lasting motivation and organization and therefore minimal effort for everybody
  - It will receive countless requests and changes over time as well as the maintenance which will be an exponential burden as time goes on.
- Tech Stack must be build on mainstream tools.
  - Its easier to on board volunteers when the tech stack follows the mainstream trends. It helps with motivation, learning curve etc...

## General concepts/entities 

- **Line:** A single line having sub-features
  - Type, ex: highline, waterline
  - Name
  - Anchors and access to anchors
  - Gear and line specs
  - Bolting and first rigger
  - Media files like photos or videos
- **Spot:** A groupings of several lines having sub-features
  - Name
  - Contact information, ex: local club
  - Access details
  - Restriction details
- **User:** An individual ISA registered user or a ISA member club(described below) having features
  - name surname
  - country
  - clubs and association list that is member of

## ISA User System
There has to be a user management system (currently facebook etc is used) but other projects like ranking list also requires the same, therefore a single user system for entire ISA products is the most sensible option, where people
- can use single email-password to login to their profiles
- can be assigned to multiple associations and clubs.
- can register on behalf associations nd share their credentials inside their clubs to give permissions to their members to maintain their lines and spots etc. 

**This user system is out of the scope for slackmap. It will be carried out separately.**

## Initial Functionalities
- Users can edit all the information related to a line or spot
- Users who initially create the line/spot will be the `owner` of the entity,
  - Other users can request temporary permissions to edit the line/spot info.
  - Owners can confirm or reject the permission request. It will be preferable that the local associations are the owner of the line/spots(ex: they will be informed via mail to give permission to user X for editing line X for 7 days)
  - Owners can transfer the ownership to the other users (in case they are not related to the entity anymore, or wanna transfer to local association)
- User will directly have edit permissions if the line/spot is owned by the association the are member of, otherwise request permissions from the owner. 
- User can query the line/spots based on
  - line/spot name, country, owner-name
- Map interface with minimal obstruction in the screen where people can navigate on the map to get an overview.
- Map offers a good quality satellite images
- Line/Spot creating and editing happens in separate page instead of a popup to provide a clear space to work on.
- Line and Spots are marked distinctively in the map.
- Creating the line supports drawing line on the map interactively
