### The vision of SlackMap

As International Slackline Association, we think SlackMap is a highly important project for the community. For everyone in interest, we'd like to share our vision with you.

#### Core Values

- The information SlackMap offers should enable global communities to interact and share their works with the world.
- The platform provides easy and free access/storage for slackliners to document their slacklines and enhance the local community of slackliners, making it easy for members to carry out slacklining easier and safer.
- It is entirely open source. The code and data are never meant to be hidden for private use and are always available for people with good intentions and efforts.

#### Basic Principles

- We want SlackMap to survive many many years and it is a challenging thing in volunteered projects. We have seen many examples over the years. Therefore, simplicity is the primary goal. We don't want to add every feature we can think of and end up with a project hard to maintain. People will lose motivation over time. The simpler, the better is the first principle. For this, even some trade-offs might be made to sacrifice some detailed functionality to not increase the complexity.
- Developers from the community should be involved as much as possible. If people become part of the project we can achieve more things and keep the project up and improving throughout the years.
- Contributors should own their works for years to come. We don't seek 'one-time improvement and done'. If your improvement needs maintenance you should be standing behind it.
- This is a 100% volunteer-based project. People willing to contribute should come with self-motivation in order to create less burden on others. This means doing prior work of reading, trying to understand first on your own, self-assessment, etc to a certain degree.

## Repository Structure

This is a multi-project repository for simplicity and ease of access.

The repository is structured as follows:

- [web](./web): The web application of SlackMap
- [server](./server): The server-side resources of SlackMap like API, database, etc.
- [docs](./docs): Documentation of the project (TODO)
