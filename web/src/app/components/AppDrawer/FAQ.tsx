      <h2>General</h2>
      <h3>What is the history of SlackMap?</h3>
      <p>
        Slackmap was originally started by Piotr BÅ‚aszczak from Poland. In the past couple years the
        maintenance work got too overwhelming and he was looking for alternatives.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ISA skipped in and Can Sahin from Turkey took on the task to recreate slackmap from
        scratch, working with a small group of people to define the requirements of a new Slackmap.
      </p>
      <p>
        Can Sahin created the new webapp with about a tenth of the code compared to the old
        slackmap, following the principle of simplicity, building it with generic features. This
        minimizes maintenance and also lowers the entry bar for new programmers who want help keep
        slackmap alive in the future. This further means that new features will only be integrated
        if they can also follow these principles. Furthermore the slackline groups data, originally
        created by Kimberly Weglin, Ryan Jenks and Grant Mercier was imported into a worldwide
        community map.
      </p>
      <p>
        At a strategic level the ISA Nature and Access Commission, a ISA suborganization, is in
        charge of Slackmap, deciding on the implementation and changes of new features, mentoring
        with local communities and interest groups and deciding in case of access conflicts.
      </p>

          <strong>Spots:</strong> Areas with multiple lines, marked with green color,

          paths, restricted areas etc.) marked with an orange color.

      <h3>How is SlackMap funded and developed?</h3>

        SlackMap is funded by Slackline International and developed by volunteers from the slackline
        community. We need your help to keep SlackMap up to date and to add new features. All the
        work is done on a voluntary basis.
